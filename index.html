                    <p>
                        Hi, I'm Ethan! I'm a mechanical engineer with three years of service as an officer
                        in the United States Air Force. I've worked in several different jobs, such as being
                        the subject matter expert for the T-6 air conditioning and pressurization systems. I'm
                        currently stationed at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, but my hometown is New Athens,
                        Illinois, a small town near St. Louis, Missouri.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm currently working on transitioning careers to the civilian sector as a software
                        developer. I'm working through a Full-Stack Engineer certification via 
                        <a class="text-link" href="https://www.codecademy.com/career-journey/full-stack-engineer">Codecademy</a>
                        , with relevant coursework including:
                        HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git & GitHub, React, Redux, Express.js, PostreSQL, Swagger, OpenAPI,
                        and DevOps Fundamentals. As of November 2023, I am 29% complete with an expected completion
                        date of Spring 2024.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On a personal note, I'm happily married to my wife, Nicole, since August 2020. We have
                        a beautiful 1 year old son named Trevor with another boy on the way. We have a 4 year old
                        labrador retriever named Apollo who loves to go on walks and play tug-o-war!
